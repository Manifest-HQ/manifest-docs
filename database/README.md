- **Database**: A structured collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage large amounts of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.

- **Schema**: The organizational structure of a database, defining how data is stored, organized, and related. It includes tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, and other elements.

- **Table**: A collection of related data entries consisting of rows and columns. Each table in a database represents a specific entity, such as users, products, or orders.

- **Field (or Column)**: A single piece of data within a table. Each field has a specific data type, such as integer, string, or date, and represents an attribute of the entity described by the table.

- **Row (or Record)**: A single, complete set of fields within a table. Each row represents one instance of the entity described by the table.

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. The primary key ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed.

- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in the two tables.

- **Index**: A database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently searched or used in join operations.

- **View**: A virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query. Views allow users to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and present data in a specific format without altering the underlying tables.

- **Migration**: The process of applying changes to the database schema, such as adding or modifying tables, fields, or relationships. Migrations help manage the evolution of the database structure over time.
